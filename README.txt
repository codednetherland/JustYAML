[purpose]
This is a library to read and write YAML.
At first there will be an implementation of version 1.2 and later 1.0
and 1.1 will follow.

[version]
Until the tag 1.0 there will occur major changes.
Later on I want to only bugfix and implement new features till 2.0.

[tests]
If somebody wants to make unit tests with JUnit or so I would really
appreciate it. Maybe some time I will have enough time and make them.
